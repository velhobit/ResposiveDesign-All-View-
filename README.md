# Responsiv Design Test All View

## Description

This project is a study initiative in Swift aimed at developing a responsive platform for macOS. The goal is to create a tool that simulates various Apple devices, allowing for more realistic responsiveness testing while respecting the unique characteristics of each device.

Through this platform, users will be able to explore how their applications perform on different screen sizes and resolutions, providing a better understanding of responsive design needs.
